# University of Bristol Financial Engineering Lab (FEL)


This is repository for [Bristol Financial Engineering Lab (FEL)](https://uob-fintech.github.io). We use Jekyll to run our Github page that builds upon the templates from the [Bristol CNU webpage](https://bristolcnu.github.io/) and the [Kording lab webpage](http://kordinglab.com/).


## Run the page locally

To run locally, follow instruction [here](https://jekyllrb.com/) to install Jekyll then run `jekyll serve` to see in `localhost:4000`. Here is a brief install guidelines.

```bash
sudo gem install jekyll
sudo gem install rouge
jekyll serve
```


## Add posts

It's very easy to add post. All the posts are located in `_posts` folder. It arrangement is based on
date. Each post can be written in markdown format. You just have to state headers before writing: `title`, `description` and `categories`. `description` will be shown when you share on social media like Facebook or twitter. See the following headers:

```
---
title: Title here
description: Description here
categories: news
---
```

Use `news` category for all news related posts. 


## How to add posts


- **Directly edit on Github**, you can simply go to `_posts` and click `New file` then put some markdown file e.g. `2016-02-03-post-name.md` and start writing blog post. Github also allows you to preview it so it's nice for people who don't want to clone the repo. 

- **Clone the repository**, kind of the same as directly add post on Github. You just have to clone the repository. Then add new post file, commit and push to the repo.

The changes will take approximately half a minute to render.


## Add yourself

You can add yourself to the page in `_people` folder just create file name `<lastname>_<firstname>.md` in the folder. We require few line of header before you start writing your own page. See the following for the header

```
---
name: Eva Dyer
position: postdoc
avatar: eva.jpg
twitter:
joined: 2014
---
```

If you don't have information, just leave it blank. The avatar will bring photo from `images/people` folder and display it on people page. To avoid your image getting stretched, you should scale it to **200x230 pixels**.
If you have a personal webpage, you can include it under `website`. Adding a webpage will link to your site instead of showing your page here.
For lab position, you can choose position from 4 classes including `postdoc`, `gradstudent`, `visiting`, `others` (so called Honorary members). Position will put you into section that you choose.
For alumni, choose betweeen `alumni_leader`, `alumni_ra`, `alumni_phd`.
