A warm welcome to Mr Wenyu Gu, who joins us this month to begin his PhD studies, supervised by Prof Dave Cliff and Dr Wei Wei. Wenyu is a recent graduate of our own [MSc Financial Technology with Data Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/msc-financial-technology-with-data-science/), University of Bristol, UK, where he spent the year as Student Rep. Wenyu's PhD is funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) - University of Bristol (UoB) PhD Scholarships Programme, and his research will explore agent-based simulation modelling and AI-methods for automated trading.
