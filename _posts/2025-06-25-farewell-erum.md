A warm farewell to visiting PhD student Erum Iftikhar, who is leaving us at the end of June. Since joining us in January, Erum has been exploring risk management mechanisms in DeFi lending, resulting in a conference paper pre-print ([available: arXiv:2506.12855](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.12855)). Erum will now head to Rome to begin her new six-month research visit at the National Research Council, Institute for Studies on Federal Regional Systems and Autonomies ([Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche â€“ Istituto di Studi sui Sistemi Regionali Federali e sulle Autonomie](https://www.issirfa.cnr.it/)), where she will work under the supervision of Dr. Riccardo Fava on the design of blockchain-based complementary currency systems for supporting community welfare. We wish Erum best of luck for the future!
