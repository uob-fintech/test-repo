A warm welcome to Ms Shiyu Zhang, who joins us this month to begin her PhD studies, supervised by Dr Zining Wang, Dr Jin Zheng, and Prof John Cartlidge. Shiyu joins us from the Chinese University of Hongkong, where she received an MSc in Mathematics. Shiyu's PhD is funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) - University of Bristol (UoB) PhD Scholarships Programme, and her research will explore mechanism design in decentralised exchange protocols.
