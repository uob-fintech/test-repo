I'm pleased to share that UKRI EPSRC have awarded £12m to fund [Artificial Intelligence for Collective Intelligence (AI4CI)](https://ai4ci.ac.uk/), as part of an [£80m national initiative on AI](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/february-/ai-hubs.html). The AI4CI Hub is a UKRI National AI Research Hub involving universities from each of the UK’s four constituent nations and over forty initial stakeholder partners from across academia, government, charities and industry. It will addres key societal challenges in Environmental Intelligence, Financial Stability, Healthcare Ecosystems, Human-Centered Design, Infrastructure and Governance, Pandemic Resilience, and Smart City Design. Hub Director Prof Seth Bullock is a member of [ISL](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/groups/intelligent-systems/) and FEL's John Cartlidge will co-lead the Hub's theme on Financial Stability with Prof Maggie Chen of University of Cardiff. Over the next 5 years, AI4CI will fund two PDRAs and one PhD Studentship to work with John and the team in FEL.
