After interviewing a strong field of candidates for the role of PDRA on the [Stratlib.AI](https://ffnews.com/newsarticle/funding/stratiphy-leads-1-million-consortium-to-advance-trustworthy-ai-solutions-in-financial-services/) project, I'm pleased to share that our own Yunhua Pei and Zinuo (Henry) You will both be taking on the role part-time, while continuing to work on their PhDs. Under the supervision of John Cartlidge, Henry's research will focus on explainable AI approaches to black-box optimisation of financial investment models, while Yunhua will focus on cross-modal AI models for financial forecasting.
